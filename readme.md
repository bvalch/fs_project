Description:
CRUD functionality:
Users able to view, edit, delete and save favourites. Additionally we implemented a quiz and a game, both relying on data fetched from 2 collections that we consolidated in MongoDB. 1 collection mocks an API and the other used to store and delete favourites. Tests have been implemented to ensure that the app is working as expected. 
To run tests please execute the following commands in the client folder:
npm run tests

Custom music added across all pages implemented through Howler. 

We hope you enjoy!
